# STT218
The package takes all of the functions that Dr. Ciminelli has created for the purposes of STT 218, and concatenates them into a single package. Rather than download and source in all of the files seperately, they are now all included in a single, easy to install, package. Included herein are the following (subject to increase as new functions are introduced in class): Linear trend, relative risk, odds ratios, and local odds ratios.
