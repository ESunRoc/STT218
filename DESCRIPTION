Description: The package takes all of the functions that Dr. Ciminelli 
  has created for the purposes of STT 218, and concatenates them into a 
  single package. Rather than download and source in all of the files seperately, 
  they are now all included in a single, easy to install, package. 
  Included herein are the following (subject to increase as new functions 
  are introduced in class): Linear trend, relative risk, odds ratios, and local 
  odds ratios.
